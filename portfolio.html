            "Luca Clicker is a idle style game that uses loops and iteration to create automation with management.<br>
             When The player clicks the cookie, it fires off an event that updates the cookie variable, then the scoreboard to that new variable.<br>
             An infinite while loop allows the cookie to spin in a circle for eternity, checks to see if any auto-clickers have been bought during the end of it's current cycle.<br>
             Iteration is used to determine if the player is able to afford each type of autoclicker using the variables that count the cookies.<br>
             All of the buttons and the cookie are indidual turtles that use to onclick event to detect keystrokes made hovering over each image."

            "Protect the Kingdom from Bugs is a castle defense style hame where your cursor is your main weapon. Varieties of bugs attempt to invade your kingdom using turtle and random methods inside fuctions which are nested in two main threaded loops.<br>
            We use iteration to determine whether the bugs were successful at invading the kingdom and if they do, a global score variable is altered. 
            We enhance the effects of the game by using pygame's mixer to add sound effects as well as backround music. 
            Finally, we had a seperate script in order to handle our leaderboard's function, retriving it's data from a txt file that stores names and scores."
